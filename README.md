# TurboGrid
Easy way to implement a hexagonal grid in Unity using cube coordinates.
The TurboGrid namespace handles creating and storing the grid and calculations to retrieve specific tiles like adjacent, every in a row, etc.

The example folder has an example component that can be used how to actually implement the grid, in this case it instantiates a prefab on every tile.

Most math and calculations are based on [Red Blob Games'](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) article.
